# CirclePacking

![Example](23x35.png "Example solution")

This is a super simple demonstration for finding the number and positions of equally spaced circles in a rectangle.  It is based on the paper of [Hifi and M'Hallah (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1155/2009/150624 "A Literature Review on Circle and Sphere Packing Problems: Models and Methodologies").  It uses the Global Optimization Toolbox in Matlab.

It is certainly not ready for prime time, and no guarantee of accuracy is provided.
